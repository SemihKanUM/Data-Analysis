# Data Analysis – Assignments & Projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks from my **Data Analysis** course.  
The assignments cover the entire workflow of data science: from basic Python programming to data wrangling, exploratory analysis, machine learning, optimization, and external data acquisition.

## 📂 Contents

### 🐍 Python Foundations
- **`basic-python-I.ipynb`** – Introduction to Python programming and Jupyter Notebooks. Covers variables, loops, functions, conditionals, and Markdown for documentation.

### 📊 Data Cleaning & Exploration
- **`DA-clinic1.ipynb`** – Real-world data analysis clinic. Tasks include:
  - Loading and cleaning noisy datasets with `pandas`
  - Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Creating visualizations and deriving insights
  - Reflecting on the societal impact of datasets

### 📈 Regression & Modeling
- **`LinearRegression1-2024.ipynb`** – Simple & multiple linear regression using `statsmodels` and `scikit-learn`.  
- **`LinearRegression2-2024.ipynb`** – Advanced regression concepts: cross-validation, overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, and regularization.  
- **`gradient-descent-reminder.ipynb`** – Refresher on optimization. Demonstrates how gradient descent works to minimize functions and its connection to model training.

### 🌍 Data Acquisition
- **`apis-2024.ipynb`** – Working with REST APIs using the `requests` library. Includes handling JSON data and interpreting HTTP status codes.  
- **`scraping-2024.ipynb`** – Web scraping with `BeautifulSoup`. Covers parsing HTML, navigating the DOM, and extracting information when no API is available.
